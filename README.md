# reflectionist README

A vscode extension that helps you to reflect on your day and help you organize your thoughts for tomorrow!

## Features

**Taking a break and focusing on the self is one of the best ways to combat exhaustion and burnout.**

Reflection is important and most of us do it less frequent than we should, so I would like to bring this closer to our work, keeping a journal is great but just typing your thoughts here it would be even easier. 
### Reflect on your day.

The main feature of this extension is to ask you a couple of questions to help you reflect on your day and to plan ahead.

### Look back on your reflections.

Your reflections will be stored as a Markdown file in your user root folder, so you can look back on your reflections.
